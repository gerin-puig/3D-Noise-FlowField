# 3D-Noise-FlowField
 An audio visualizer created from an online tutorial with my own additions and changes.

## Instructions
- Use your own music but has to be a .wav
  or one of the preloaded ones.
- When in the Flowfield **look around by holding down right mouse-click**.
- Move around using **W, A, S, D**.
- Feel free to play with the values in options.
